## My map

My personal dream is to make friends from all countries. This map tracks the countries my friends and professional partners come from and I have visited.

A published map is [here](http://rpubs.com/ash_k/my_map).

The codes referred to this [website](https://warin.ca/posts/rcourse-datavisualizationwithr-customcolorsmaps/).

The shape files of countries' boundaries were downloaded from [Esri ArcGIS Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::world-countries-generalized/about).

## My map in the US
