# friends_around_the_world
My personal dream is to make friends from every country. This map tracks the countries my friends and colleagues come from.

A published map is [here](http://rpubs.com/ash_k/my_map).

The codes referred to this [website](https://warin.ca/posts/rcourse-datavisualizationwithr-customcolorsmaps/).

The shape files of countries' boundaries were downloaded from [Esri ArcGIS Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::world-countries-generalized/about).
